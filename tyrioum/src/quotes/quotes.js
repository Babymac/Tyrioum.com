	{item_number: 4, quote: "You are your mother's trueborn son of Lannister. Am I? the dwarf replied, sardonic. Do tell my lord father. My mother died birthing me, and he's never been sure. I don't even know who my mother was, Jon said. Some woman, no doubt. Most of them are. He favored Jon with a rueful grin. Remember this, boy. All dwarfs may be bastards, yet not all bastards need be dwarfs."},

	{item_number: 5, quote: "Would you rather be called the Imp? Let them see that their words can cut you and you’ll never be free of the mockery. If they want to give you a name take it make it your own. Then they can’t hurt you with it anymore."},

	{item_number: 10, quote: "How could I not love him, after that? That is not to say that I approved of all he did, or much enjoyed the company of the man that he became... but every little girl needs a big brother to protect her. Tywin was big even when he was little. She gave a sigh. Who will protect us now? Jaime kissed her cheek. He left a son. Aye, he did. That is what I fear the most, in truth. That was a queer remark. Why should you fear? Jaime, she said, tugging on his ear, sweetling, I have known you since you were a babe at Joanna’s breast. You smile like Gerion and fight like Tyg, and there’s some of Kevan in you, else you would not wear that cloak... but Tyrion is Tywin’s son, not you. I said so once to your father’s face, and he would not speak to me for half a year. Men are such thundering great fools. Even the sort who come along once in a thousand years."},

	{item_number: 17, quote: "Tyrion let the eunuch help him mount. Lord Varys, he said from the saddle, sometimes I feel as though you are the best friend I have in King's Landing and sometimes I feel you are my worst enemy."},

	{item_number: 18, quote: "And what lesson can we draw from Volantene history? If you want to conquer the world, you best have dragons"},

	{item_number: 19, quote: "Perhaps that is the secret. It is not what we do, so much as why we do it."},
